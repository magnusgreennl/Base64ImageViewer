# Base64ImageViewer
This widget is used to display Image from an Encoded Base64 String value without the need for System.Image Generalization. Store the Base64 value in a string attribute in an entity. Place the Widget inside a Dataview and map the string attribute which has the Base64 Value.

This is a custom change for IB to allow for height/width values other than percentages.
